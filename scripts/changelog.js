      version: "0.4.4",
      title: "Prone and dnd5e token cover",
      body: `\
          - **Prone status:** Added a setting to allow the GM to identify a "prone" status for tokens.
            Tokens with the prone status will be treated as half-height for vision and cover.
            As a result, there is not longer a separate dead token setting for half height cover.
            Setting dead tokens to prone will cause them to be treated as half-height.
          - **dnd5e cover:** Added option to treat tokens as providing a maximum of low (half) cover.
            Under this option, tokens will not otherwise contribute to cover. For area algorithms,
            the token must provide at least low cover to count for cover.
          - **Updated Settings:** Settings have been updated accordingly.
            You may need to update your preferred default settings accordingly.`
    })

    .addEntry({
      version: "0.5.4",
      title: "DFred's compatibility and new features",
      body: `\
          - **DFred's:** If DFred's Convenient Effects module is loaded, all three cover effects from DFred's
            (half, three-quarters, total) will be used instead of this module's defaults. Requires
            DFred's version 5.1.1.
          - **Macros:** Existing macros were improved and new macros added. If you were previously using
            the Alternative Token Visibility macros, you will need to reinstall them from the compendium.
            Added a Set Cover macro to allow the user to confirm or change cover choices and apply
            the active effects for the chosen cover(s) for targets. Added a Vision Debug that
            displays debug lines similar to the Cover Debug Tester.
          - **Ignore Prone:** New setting will ignore prone tokens for purposes of cover.
          - **Modified Cover Workflow:** You can now choose to have a dialog appear for the GM or the
            user when the attack button is used for an item. Previously, this workflow was limited to
            when the midiqol module was present.
          - **New Vision Option:** You can now select "Corner to Corner" as a line-of-sight vision option.
            This will allow tokens to be seen by other tokens if the corner of a token has line-of-sight to
            the corner of another token, which mimics the dnd5e DMG rule. This is equivalent to the corner-to-corner
            cover option.`

    .addEntry({
      version: "0.6.0",
      title: "Split Token Visibility from Token Cover",
      body: `\
          To simplify the module and improve debugging, I have split out token cover from
          token visibility. There are now two modules: [Alternative Token Visibility](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-token-visibility) and
          [Alternative Token Cover](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-token-cover). You can use one module without
          the other, or both in combination.`
